# Blog with monitoring and observability

## Project Description

This open-source project simulates a complete infrastructure with advanced monitoring and observability capabilities. It is designed to demonstrate the integration and joint operation of various popular technologies, providing a robust educational and experimental environment. The infrastructure includes multiple databases, object storage, web servers, and monitoring and log analysis tools. It is ideal for developers and system administrators who want to learn and experiment with a comprehensive modern system setup.
